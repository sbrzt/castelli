# Castelli Data Management

## Description

Data management for Emilia-Romagna Castles project.

The repository is organized as follows:
* the `docs` folder contains the project documentation and other relevant static resources.
* the `analysis` folder contains a set of Jupyter notebooks used to examine and visualize the data, as well as to draw conclusions and/or questions about the data and what to do with it.
* the `processing` folder cointains a set of Jupyter notebooks used to conduct certain processing operations on the existing data, such as integration with new data from outer sources (like APIs).
